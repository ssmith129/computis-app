## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Active Voice**: "Generate report" not "Report will be generated"
- **Present Tense**: "Review transactions" not "You will review"
- **Second Person**: "Your transactions" not "User transactions"
- **Contractions**: Use sparingly in UI, freely in help content

### Technical Terms

**Preferred Terms:**

- Transaction (not "tx" or "txn")
- Cryptocurrency (not "crypto" in formal contexts)

**Avoid Jargon:**

- Instead of "FIFO/LIFO" use "First in, first out"
- Instead of "DeFi" use "Decentralized finance"
- Instead of "Gas fees" use "Network fees"

### Number and Date Formatting

- **Currencies**: Always include currency symbol ($1,234.56)
- **Dates**: Use clear format (March 15, 2024)
- **Large Numbers**: Use commas (1,234 transactions)
- **Percentages**: Include % symbol (95% complete)

### Help and Support Content

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, offer detail on demand
