## How to Use

1. Open `design-elements-index.html` in a browser to see the overview
2. Click any design element card to view its interactive prototype
3. Each page includes:
   - Problem statement
   - Solution description
   - Interactive workflow examples
   - Real impact metrics

## Technologies Used

- Pure HTML5 with semantic markup
- Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Shared assets from `../assets/`:
  - `styles.css` - Global styles
  - `app.js` - Common utilities (toast, navigation, etc.)

## Design Principles

All prototypes follow these UX principles:

1. **Trust through Transparency** - AI decisions are always explainable
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complex information revealed contextually
3. **Professional Autonomy** - CPAs maintain control over all decisions
4. **Contextual Access** - Tools available where decisions are made
5. **Role-Based Design** - Interfaces adapt to user permissions
